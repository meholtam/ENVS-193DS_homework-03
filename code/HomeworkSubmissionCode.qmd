Problem 1: Personal Data

a.  Data summarizing

    I am calculating the mean number of steps I took each day to compare average step count between weekdays. I believe I walk the most on Wednesdays, because I have classes to walk to but also free time to work out and go on walks as I do not have work, so I am curious if my data reflects this.

b.  Visualization

    ```{r personal visualization}
    my_data <- read.csv("193DS Data - Sheet1.csv")

    ```
